     <p>\n        Hi there! Thanks for stopping by my page. I'm currently a Computer Science undergraduate from \n        the National University of Singapore. My undergraduate journey will be ending really soon and \n        I'm very excited to begin my career as a UX Designer. I love cracking my brain to solve challenging\n        user problems; my passion for this UX stems from my desire to reconcile my interest for human\n        psychology and my field of study.\n\n        In my leisure time, you can often find me playing Animal Crossing (yes, I know the hype has \n        died down) and Stardew Valley on my Nintendo Switch. I'm also fond of embarking on new \"artistic\" \n        endeavours — my latest hobbies are embroidery and air-dry clay.\n\n        Currently, I'm looking for new internship opportunities.<br></br>\n        <div id=\"note\">\n          <i>P.S.: I built this website myself with my very limited React development skills; do let me know if you see any funky bugs.

We were given a set of requirements \n            that our website had to fulfill, which were:<br/>\n            <div className=\"bulletpoint\">\n                <ul className=\"list\">\n                    <li>users can sign up to be a pet owner and/or a pet caretaker</li>\n                    <li>pet owners can indicate the number of pets they have, and the details of their pets \n                        (i.e. type of pet, pet name, and special requirements)</li>\n                    <li>pet owners can search for pet caretakers and see their reviews and ratings</li>\n                    <li>pet owners can bid for the service of a pet caretaker</li>\n                    <li>pet caretakers can indicate their availabilities, rates, and the types of pets \n                        that are able to take care of from a specified list</li>\n                    <li>pet caretakers can view and accept bids from pet owners, and apply for leave</li>\n                    <li>website administrators can verify caretakers, approve caretakers' leaves, and add new pet categories</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n            There was a lot that needed to be done for the development of the website and the project report, hence, \n            we had to split the work. I was tasked to do the report, prototype of the user interface, and the \n            front-end development of the various webpages.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2><b>Initial prototype creation</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            Since our professor placed more emphasis on whether our website worked rather than the user experience \n            of the website, I quickly created a simple prototype of the website so that the group could quickly \n            start on development. The prototype was created on Adobe XD. I decided on varying shades of orange for \n            the colour scheme. Orange matches our web application as the group felt that the website should \n            be playful and inviting so as to encourage more users to the website.<br/><br/>\n\n            <div className=\"image-grid\">\n                <img src={pca1} width=\"90%\" alt=\"\"/>\n                <img src={pca2} width=\"90%\" alt=\"\"/>\n                <img src={pca3} width=\"90%\" alt=\"\"/>\n                <img src={pca4} width=\"90%\" alt=\"\"/>\n                <img src={pca5} width=\"90%\" alt=\"\"/>\n                <img src={pca6} width=\"90%\" alt=\"\"/>\n            </div>\n        </p>\n\n        <h2><b>Developing the front-end interface</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            The group decided to build our web application using Angular, as those who were familiar with any \n            frameworks were most familiar with Angular. As we only had a few weeks to finish the application and the report, \n            our team split into two teams: front-end team and the back-end team. I was part of the front-end team, and there were two of us. \n            Initially, I was just responsible for styling the website -- my team mate would create a HTML file with all \n            the necessary Angular components needed for data handling, and I would just style the components to match \n            the prototype. However, my team mate was slowly became overwhelmed with his academic work and I had to quickly\n            pick up Angular to assist him.<br/><br/>\n            This was quite challenging as I was already struggling with styling the HTML that were already given to me \n            as my team mate made use of Angular Material components instead of native HTML components (i.e. tables, cards, forms, \n            etc.). Styling the Angular Material components was quite a struggle for me as I was confused on how to override the original \n            styles of the components. Angular Material's Select component, in particular, was incredibly confusing for me as I struggled \n            with removing the label in the form field and subsequently, resizing the height of the component. However, after reading through \n            multiple Stack Overflow posts on customising components and doing some trial and error on my end, I was able to find fixes for all \n            of my styling problems. Other than that, I also faced some difficulties when I had to take on some of my team mate's responsibilities \n            and create the HTML files with the Angular components. One of the biggest issue I faced was with data handling. My other team mate, \n            that was part of the back-end team, was responsible for creating the API that interacted with our database. We had to make use of \n            the API to get and submit data to the database. Although it was confusing at first, after re-reading the documentation, going through\n            some Angular data handling tutorials, and referring to existing code, I managed to pull-through.<br/>\n        </p>\n\n        <h2><b>Quick reflection</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            This project was quite fun for me as I finally dabbled in front-end development, something that I was not really interested in \n            pursuing as I preferred back-end development. My supervisor in my previous internship always nagged at me to start learning\n            front-end development as he said it was a good skill to have as an UI/UX designer. However, I was always reluctant as I felt that\n            HTML/CSS was incredibly confusing. Unlike coding, you never really know what is wrong with the website as there is no\n            error codes to guide you, all you know is that your website looks janky and you do not really know where to start to fix. However,\n            I quickly learnt that HTML/CSS is pretty much like any other language I have learnt -- there ARE rules to it and once you are \n            familiar with the rules, trying to fix your weird-looking website does not really seem like shooting in the dark anymore.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default PetCaringApp;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/ufa2.99e26088.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/ufa3.cf628af3.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/ufa4.85388d40.png\";","import React from \"react\"\nimport \"./Pages.css\";\nimport ufa1 from \"../assets/ufa1.png\";\nimport ufa2 from \"../assets/ufa2.png\";\nimport ufa3 from \"../assets/ufa3.png\";\nimport ufa4 from \"../assets/ufa4.png\";\n \nfunction UniversityFinderApp() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"page\">\n        <div className=\"header-image\">\n            <img src={ufa1} width=\"90%\" alt=\"University finder mobile application homepage\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h1><b>University Finder Mobile Application</b></h1>\n\n        <h2><b>Background</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            For this individual project, I had to create a mobile application based on a statistic from the Government website. Basically, we had to find a statistic from any Government agency that highlighted certain problems that we were facing (i.e. Dengue cases rising, etc.) and create an app that could alleviate or improve the lives of people involved in the statistic. We also had to use the stages in the Design Thinking process to create our mobile application.<br/><br/>\n            The statistic I chose was regarding the <a style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}} href=\"https://data.gov.sg/dataset/intake-enrolment-and-graduates-by-institutions\">intake and enrolment of students into tertiary educations over the years</a>. \n        </p> \n\n        <h2><b>The problem</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            Through the statistic, I found that more and more students are enrolling in local universities over the years. This was consistent with the Government's plan in 2012 to increase the cohort participation rate to 40% by 2020. However, I soon realized that despite the Government's <b>plan to increase the university participation rate</b>, many prospective university students <b>still do not have a website or app that helps students compare university degrees</b>. For example, prospective students in the UK have websites like UniversityFinder and UCAS to help them compare different university courses. <br/><br/>\n            Then, to understand more regarding the troubles of prospective university students when searching for university courses and whether the \"issue\" indicated was a problem to begin with, I interviewed a 3rd-year polytechnic student, a polytechnic graduate serving National Service, and a full-time working adult seeking to resume his studies. This also begins the \"Empathise\" phase of the Design Thinking process.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2><b>The \"Empathise\" stage</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            My user interview set out to understand the troubles of these prospective students when researching for university courses. I also wanted to better understand their background and how their background could have affected some of their troubles. Some of the guiding questions I used for the interview are written below.<br/><br/>\n            \n            <b>Questions for Getting to know the user</b>\n            <div className=\"bulletpoint\">\n                <ul className=\"list\">\n                    <li>Please tell me about yourself and briefly explain why you are planning to go to university</li>\n                    <li>Do you already have any university courses in mind? If yes, why did you consider those university courses?</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div><ul></ul>\n\n            <b>Questions for Gathering user behaviour</b>\n            <div className=\"bulletpoint\">\n                <ul className=\"list\">\n                    <li>What are the steps that you do when comparing between university courses?</li>\n                    <li>What kind of websites do you use when comparing between university courses?</li>\n                    <li>Do you have instances where you are not sure whether to consider this university course or another university course?</li>\n                    <li>What criteria do you consider when selecting a university course? Is it just course curriculum or do you consider the actual university culture, amenities, etc. also?</li>\n                    <li>Tell me your experience when comparing university courses</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div><ul></ul>\n\n            The interview really gave me a lot of insights into some of the problems that these prospective students encountered which I, myself, did not encounter when conducting my own university research. Here is a summary of the notable responses gathered from the interview:<br/><br/>\n\n            <div class=\"key-para\">\n            All of the prospective students, regardless of their background, used the same steps and same websites when conducting their research and comparing the different university courses. For all of them, they relied on university course suggestions from their friends, lecturers, and family members to \"narrow\" down the number of university courses they had to consider and compare. When comparing the university courses, all of the interviewees relied on the course website itself for information on the particular university course to make a decision. They mentioned that it was <b>tedious to compare the different university courses</b> as each university website had a different layout and some information was just easier to search for in one university website over the other university website. Furthermore, many of them also consulted forums on Reddit or HardwareZone to gather opinions and experiences from others to determine which university course was better. Hence, a typical \"session\" would end up with them having multiple tabs open as all the information is on various websites and pages.<br/><br/>\n            In all, many found their experience comparing between university courses to be very tedious. Furthermore, the part-time degree goer noted that since there was no website that consolidated all the same type of degrees that were available from all the universities in Singapore (regardless of whether it is a private or local university), he <b>almost missed out on a degree from a private university</b> that was suitable for him.\n            </div>\n        </p>\n\n        <h2><b>The \"Define\" & \"Ideate\" phase</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            From the insights gathered, I embarked on the \"Define\" phase. I analyzed the problems that were affecting the interviewees and crafting POVs (Point of View) and subsequently, How Might We (HMW) questions. The POVs and HMW questions would help me ensure that I do not stray from answering the user's needs when brainstorming for ideas in the \"Ideation\" phase. The POV I thought of was \"A prospective university student needs to be able to compare between different university courses without having to open multiple tabs and webpages because it is very tedious and they might lose track of what information they found on which webpage.\" Then, some of the HMW questions I've thought of was:<br/><br/>\n            <div className=\"bulletpoint\">\n                <ul className=\"list\">\n                    <li>How might we consolidate all important information needed when comparing between various university courses?</li>\n                    <li>How might we make it easier for prospective university students to find all opinions or experiences regarding a university course online?</li>\n                    <li>How might we present other possible university courses, that they might not have known existed, to prospective students?</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div><ul></ul>\n            With these questions in mind, I finally brainstormed some features for the mobile app. The features include: comparing two university courses based on a set of criteria and revealing the best out of the two, revealing which university course faired better in which criteria, choosing the criteria in which the universities will be compared against, consolidating all relevant information regarding the university course, and recommending other relevant university courses based on the university courses that the user has chosen. \n        </p>\n\n        <h2><b>The \"Prototype\" phase</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            After that, embarked on the \"Prototype\" phase to create my low-fi prototype.<br/><br/>\n            <div className=\"images\">\n                <img src={ufa2} alt=\"University finder app low-fi prototype\"/>\n            </div>\n        </p>\n\n        <h2><b>The \"Test\" phase</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            After creating a functional low-fi prototype on Moqups, I conducted a usability test with the same set of interviewees I had in the previous user interview. For the interview, I wanted to understand whether the app was easy to use (i.e. was the interface understandable, did the steps make sense, etc.) and whether they are able to decide which university course was best for them after having used the app. Hence, the task scenario and task for the users were:<br/><br/>\n            <div class=\"key-para\">\n            You are a polytechnic student studying Computer Engineering and you are about to graduate in a few months. You have not decided on a specific degree course yet but you do know that you intend to continue studying the same subject in university. Your internship supervisor has advised you to enter NUS Computer Engineering since the course is more established and fresh graduates' pay and employability are the highest. However, your lecturer advised you to enter SUTD Computer Engineering instead as he heard that the pay and employability of SUTD graduates' are the highest. Due to the conflicting information, you're extremely confused. Your task is to use the app to compare a few degree courses that you already have in mind and make a decision.</div><br/>\n            I also instructed the users to talk aloud when using the app, so that I am able to understand the thought process of the users. After the usability test, I asked the users some questions about their experience using the app, was there anything in the app that they found confusing when trying to complete the task, and was there anything in the app that they liked.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2><b>The \"Ideate\" & \"Prototype\" phase (again)</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            Then, from the usability test, here are some of the responses and suggestions I've gathered: \n            <div className=\"bulletpoint\">\n                <ul className=\"list\">\n                    <li>The flow makes sense but is it possible to enter in our polytechnic GPA scores? As personally, I would like to only see universities that I can apply to?</li>\n                    <li>Is it possible to add in my own categories for rating?</li>\n                    <li>It may be more useful if you actually presented the.. \"values\" for these categories? Like in the example, NUS ranked highest for graduate salary so, I want to know what's the salary?\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </div><ul></ul> \n            Some of the suggestions were considered and added into the final prototype. Having the option to add in polytechnic or IGP scores does make sense as some prospective university students do want to waste time applying for degree courses whose cut-off marks are way off from their own scores. Furthermore, adding more information about the categories would also be more useful as it helps the user understand why the ranking was as such. However, having the feature to let users add their own categories, was not added to the prototype. This is because I still needed to make the app \"code-able\" although the project did not require us to code the app. Having users add their own categories would make the ranking algorithm even more complicated as we might need to parse and best match the user's own categories, and they could have complicated or vague categories like \"Best professors\" or \"Nicer lecture halls\".<br/><br/>\n            <div className=\"images\">\n                <img src={ufa3} alt=\"University finder app mid-fi prototype\"/>\n            </div>\n        </p>\n\n\n        <h2><b>The \"Test\" phase (again)</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            After constructing the mid-fi prototype, I was instructed by the teaching team to conduct a heuristic evaluation. Heuristic evaluations help to identify usability problems in user interfaces by comparing them with widely accepted usability principles. The best practice is to use established heuristics like Nielsen’s 10 general principles for interaction design while combining them with other relevant design guidelines and market research. However, as my app is meant to be a web app and not a native Android or iPhone app, I was unable to apply any of Android or iOS design guidelines to my current user interface. Hence, I employed Nielsen’s heuristics to evaluate my current user interface.<br/><br/>\n            \n            From Nielsen's heuristic, I found that my app was lacking in:\n            <div className=\"bulletpoint\">\n                <ul className=\"list\">\n                    <li><i><b>Visibility of system status.</b></i> For the questionnaire portion of the app, the app did not indicate the completion status of the questionnaire (i.e. how many questions are left). Hence, the hi-fi prototype has a progress bar at the top of the questionnaire screens.</li>\n                    <li><i><b>Error prevention.</b></i> The app requires users to enter in the degree programme to compare. However, some users may type in the university name instead. Hence, the autocomplete textbox can recognise if the user is about to type the name of a university, and shows an error message letting them know to type in a degree name instead.</li>\n                    <li><i><b>Aesthetic and minimalist design.</b></i> Some of the decorative visual elements took up a lot of space on the screen and some even overlapped with the actual content. This could be extremely distracting and take away from the main content of the app. Hence, I needed to simplify the overall visual aesthetics and design for the hi-fi prototype.</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div><ul></ul> \n            Then, based on the heuristic evaluation, I created my final product.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2><b>The final product</b></h2>\n        <p> For a better experience, you can also visit the Adobe XD <a href=\"https://xd.adobe.com/view/0db88225-84f8-42cc-b474-4fa982bf8654-58eb/?fullscreen&hints=off\" style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>link</a> to try out the prototype.<br/><br/>\n            <div className=\"images\">\n                <img src={ufa1} alt=\"University finder app high-fi prototype\"/>\n                <img src={ufa4} alt=\"University finder app high-fi prototype\"/>\n            </div>\n        </p>\n\n        <h2><b>Quick reflection</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            I really enjoyed this project as I got to practice my UX skills on an app idea that I came up with. Furthermore, being able to design the app from scratch, and play around with fonts, visual elements and colours for the app was also incredibly satisfying. However, one thing that I would have improved on the usability testing portion of the project. As the project was done during COVID-19 times, I wasn't able to physically conduct the usability testing. Hence, I was not able to see the user's body language or facial expression when using the app. This could be insightful as non-verbal communication reveals a lot about the user's unfiltered thoughts. \n        </p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default UniversityFinderApp;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/survey1.7c47f796.png\";","import React from \"react\"\nimport \"./Pages.css\";\nimport survey1 from \"../assets/survey1.png\";\nimport survey9 from \"../assets/survey9.png\";\n\nfunction RedesignGVWebsite() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"page\">\n        <div className=\"header-image\">\n            <img src={survey9} width=\"90%\" alt=\"Redesigning Golden Village's purchasing user flow\"/>\n        </div>\n        <h1><b>Redesigning Golden Village's Website</b></h1>\n\n        <h2><b>Background</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            For this group project, we had to redesign the user interface of an existing website to improve the general user experience of a specific task in the website. Unlike all the other UX projects in my portfolio, this one is more unique as it focused more on collecting and analysing quantitative data rather than qualitative data. Hence, we had to use a Qualtrics survey and create a prototype website to collect information, and subsequently perform statistical analysis on the data.\n        </p>   \n\n        <h2><b>The problem</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            My group and I settled on redesigning and improving Golden Village's website. In particular, the user flow when the user's goal is to purchase movie tickets using the \"Quick Buy\" function. We settled on this website as we felt that improving the website could affect a significant number of people. Golden Village is one of the most popular movie theatres in Singapore. Furthermore, there are only a few ways in which you can purchase their movie tickets online, and the most common way is through their website. When you Google \"Golden village movie tickets\", the Golden Village website is one of the first few results. Moreover, even if the user tries to purchase tickets from third party websites or apps like Popcorn, the website or app will still redirect the user to the Golden Village website.<br/><br/>\n            There were a many issues that we found with the movie ticket purchasing user flow that could be improved on, however, we were encouraged to only focus one or two issues due to the fact that we only had 3 members in our team (we were supposed ot have five). Hence, our team decided to focus one main problem: <b>unoptimized layout leading to unnecessary cursor movement</b> selecting options for the movie.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2><b>Our proposed solution</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            The current implementation makes use of long dropdown menus for uses to select the options for the movie (i.e. movie title, movie theatre, and move timings). However, long dropdown menus are  inefficient based on Hick’s Law. Furthermore, the fact that the options of the dropdown menus are in an arbitrary order, makes scanning the input more tedious for the user. For our proposed solution, we decided to improve on the long dropdown menu by changing the order of the options and also introducing keyboard input. This would make scanning easier & accessible for visually-impaired users. Although these ideas are not novel, we believe that the novelty of our solution bears little bearing on the actual usability. Furthermore, we are interested to find out whether our proposed solution does make a difference.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2><b>Our experiment design</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            <h3>The research question</h3>\n            Is the new proposed auto-complete search implementation better than the existing drop-down search implementation in reducing task timing and increasing ease-of-use for booking two movie tickets from Golden Village’s website?\n            <br/><br/>\n            <h3>The experiment variables</h3>\n            Now that we have our research question, we have to determine the independent and dependent variables for our experiment. In our draft experiment design, we thought of the dependent variables: user-friendliness, speed, optimization, and attention. However, we had to replace optimization and attention as it would require complex software such as eye-tracking. Our independent variables, however, stayed the same. In the end, we had the following variables as our independent and dependent variables:<br/>\n            <div className=\"bulletpoint\">\n                <ul className=\"list\">\n                    <li>Independent variables: Cinema search bar, movie chosen (that is, index of the movie on the list), ticket type chosen (same concept as movie chosen)</li>\n                    <li>Dependent variables: User-friendliness, speed, and cognitive load</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div><ul></ul> \n            For every independent variable, we have two levels. For cinema search bar, we have autocomplete vs. dropdown. Next, for movie chosen, we have a movie whose name comes first alphabetically vs. a movie whose name comes last alphabetically. Thus, we have \"21 Bridges\" vs. \"Unhinged\" for \"movie chosen\". As ticket type chosen follows the same logic as movie chosen, we have \"Partner Rewards\" vs. \"Standard Price\".<br/><br/>\n            We will be measuring user-friendliness and cognitive load using a set of established questionnaires that has been proven to work, which is, System Usability Scale (SUS) and Single Ease Question (SEQ). As for speed, we have used Qualtric's timing feature to take note of how slow or fast the user finishes the question. Initially, we were supposed to implement logging.js on our prototype website to take note of the user's time taken. However, we were unable to do so. Hence, I suggested the idea of using Qualtric's timing feature and implemented it.<br/><br/>\n      \n            <h3>The counterbalancing strategy & arrangement conditions</h3>\n            Next, we had to decide the counterbalancing strategy and the arrange factorial conditions for our independent variables (IV). For the IVs \"Cinema search bar\" and \"Movie chosen\", we have decided on within-subjects and a full counterbalancing strategy as within-subjects can minimize the random noise caused by differences in subjects. Furthermore, since we only have 2 levels for each IV, full conterbalancing would have the same number of arrangements as partial counterbalancing. As for the IV \"Ticket type chosen\", we have chosen between-subjects instead of within-subjects as we had to take into account the increased cost of experiment and fatigue for the participants. Then, we have the following arrange factorial conditions:<br/><br/>\n            <table>\n            <tr>\n                <th>No.</th>\n                <th>Cinema search bar</th>\n                <th>Movie chosen</th>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>1</td>\n                <td>Autocomplete</td>\n                <td>21 Bridges</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>2</td>\n                <td>Autocomplete</td>\n                <td>Unhinged</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>3</td>\n                <td>Dropdown</td>\n                <td>21 Bridges</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>4</td>\n                <td>Dropdown</td>\n                <td>Unhinged</td>\n            </tr>\n            </table><br/>\n            Hence, each participant would be exposed to four different combinations during the experiment; the arrangement of each combination, however, would differ for each participant. Lastly, our group had to determine the trial tasks for the participants. Our trial task is relatively simple and straightforward, the participants has to purchase two movie tickets with specific movie and timing information we would give. \n        </p>\n\n        <h2><b>Our survey questions</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            We used Qualtrics to for our survey questionnaire. Based on our arrangement sequences and our Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) of our trial task, each participant would take approximately 25 minutes for our survey (including breaks and lag time). The survey is divided into 8 sections: introductory blurb, consent form, training tutorial, screening questions, UX trial questions, post-questionnaire, and conclusion blurb. If you're interested, you can try out our full survey  <a style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}} href=\"https://nus.syd1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dbWcUGT3nB3hNwF\">here</a>.<br/><br/>\n\n            <div className=\"images\">\n                <img src={survey1} width=\"100%\" alt=\"\"/>\n            </div>\n        </p>\n\n        <h2><b>Our results analysis</b></h2>\n        <p>\n        <h3>The analysis goals</h3>\n        We had two main questions we wanted answers to from our analysis:\n        <div className=\"bulletpoint\">\n            <ul className=\"list\">\n                <li>Is the time taken to book a movie longer using the drop-down search method than the  auto-complete search method?</li>\n                <li>Is the drop-down search method easier to use than the auto-complete search method?</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div><ul></ul>\n\n        <h3>The preparation & preprocessing of data</h3>\n        Firstly, sensitive or private information about the participant such as IP address and name were removed from the raw survey data. Next, irrelevant columns that were generated by Qualtrics, like survey start date, were removed as well. After all the irrelevant and sensitive information were removed, the SUS scores, SEQ scores, and time taken had to be calculated for each participant arrangement. In particular, SUS scores had to be calculated based on the following method:\n        <div className=\"bulletpoint\">\n            <ul className=\"list\">\n                <li>For each of the odd numbered questions, subtract 1 from the score.</li>\n                <li>For each of the even numbered questions, subtract their value from 5.</li>\n                <li>Take these new values which you have found, and add up the total score. Then multiply this by 2.5.</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div><ul></ul>\n        As for the time taken per trial had to be calculated based on the following formula: Page Submit - First Click. Since there were 3 trial tasks per participant arrangement, we had to take the average time taken for each participant arrangement. Lastly, the SUS scores, SEQ scores, and time taken were then arranged into a long data table whilst the pre-questionnaire and post-questionnaire answers were arranged into a wide data table.\n        <br/><br/>\n\n        <h3>The preliminary analysis</h3>\n        Firstly, we analysed the speed. To analyse speed, we had to perform a logarithmic transformation on the Time Taken data to as the data is very skewed and has a histogram that is not symmetric. We had to do this as the subsequent statistical analysis methods require data to first be more normal in distribution (so as to detect outliers more easily, stabilize variance, and check for normality of the errors). After doing so, we found out that the <b>drop-down method is 3 seconds faster than the autocomplete method on average</b>. Secondly, we analysed the user-friendliness by looking at the data of the SUS scores. We found that for both methods, our <b>mean SUS scores were below the industry standards</b>. For context, the industry standard is 68, but the drop-down method and autocomplete method scored 34 and 35 respectively. Lastly, we analysed the cognitive load by considering the SEQ scores. Our findings showed us that the <b>auto-complete method had a higher SEQ score than the drop-down method</b>. However, the difference was marginal as the auto-complete method had a score of 4.9 while the drop-down method had a score of 4.7. In all, the preliminary analysis showed us that the difference in usability between the two methods are marginally small. However, further analysis should still be done to determine the significance of the differences.<br/><br/>\n\n        <h3>The statistical tests</h3>\n        Since our experiment is a mixed design, with one between-subjects IV and two within-subjects IV, <b>Linear Mixed Effects Model was used as our statistical test</b>. We had to perform the statistical test on each of our DVs, hence, the Response for each test would change accordingly. The Linear Mixed Effects Model test revealed to us that there were <b>no significant effects</b> between the drop-down and autocomplete method. The details of one of our statistical tests on the user-friendliness DV can be seen below.<br/><br/>\n        <div className=\"key-para\"> We conducted a Linear Mixed Effects Model to test how the movie chosen (within-subjects), cinema search bar (within-subjects) and Ticket Type (between-subjects) affected user-friendliness when purchasing movie tickets. The analysis showed that participants had i) no significant difference in perceived user-friendliness when using dropdown search method than when using the autocomplete search method, F(1, 21) = 0.7713, p = 0.3897, ii)  no significant difference in user-friendliness when selecting the movie “21 Bridges” than “Unhinged”, F(1, 21) = 0.1141, p = 0.7389, no significant difference in user-friendliness between the ticket type “Standard Price” and “Partner Reward”, F(1, 7) = 1.9337, p = 0.2063. There were also no significant interactions between i) movie chosen and search method (p = 0.6651), ii) search method and ticket type chosen (p = 0.1352), iii) movie chosen and ticket type chosen (p = 0.7389), and iv) search method, ticket type chosen, and movie chosen (p = 0.9202).</div>\n        </p><br/>\n\n        <h2><b>The conclusion</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            We did not find significant effects from changing different things from the current website. The conclusion is that the <b>test is not successful in determining if there is an improvement in user-friendliness and time taken</b> for movie-goers to book movie tickets on a website that uses an autocomplete search bar as compared to a website that uses a dropdown list. However, this is inconclusive to whether autocomplete search bars are better than dropdown lists for movie booking websites as there could be many variables that have contributed to the unsuccessful experiment.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2><b>A quick reflection</b></h2>\n        <p>\n            In hindslight, there were lots of improvements that could have been made to our experiment. Firstly, we could have increase the variability for the between-subjects groups by either having participants that were of different age groups and occupation, as all our participants were university students between the ages of 21 and 25. Alternatively, we could have had participants of varying skills in technology as all our participants indicated being good with technology. Overall, since we had to work with a lot less members than expected, I felt that the quality of our project suffered. The group had a lot of ideas for the experiment, like measuring accuracy on top of the three DVs we already had. We wanted to see if our new method would decrease the number of mistakes users made while completing the test. Moreover, we also had other IVs in mind as we were plannint to make bigger improvements for the purchasing user flow. Some of the improvements we wanted to make were reorganizing the steps for the purchasing process and switching the layout for the purchasing form pages. However, we were advised by the teaching team to tackle a smaller issue as a bigger change would mean more IVs, which could be a problem due to our small team size. Hence, I was slightly disappointed at what our project could have been. Despite that, I still learnt a lot regarding statistical analysis in the context of UX experiments, that I had not picked up from any of the previous UX modules and internships.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default RedesignGVWebsite;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport \"./App.css\";\n\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch, Link, Redirect } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport { Navigation, Home, About, PetCaringApp, UniversityFinderApp, RedesignGVWebsite } from \"./components\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"app\">\n      <div className=\"container\">\n        <Router>\n          <div className=\"nav-container\">\n            <Navigation />\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"main-container\">\n            <Switch>\n              <Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home} />\n              <Route exact path=\"/about\" component={About} />\n              <Route exact path=\"/pet-caring-app\" component={PetCaringApp} />\n              <Route exact path=\"/university-finder-app\" component={UniversityFinderApp} />\n              <Route exact path=\"/redesign-gv-website\" component={RedesignGVWebsite} />\n            </Switch>\n          </div>\n        </Router>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
